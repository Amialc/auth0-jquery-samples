# Calling API

This example shows how to make authenticated API calls using `$.ajax()` in your jQuery application. To do this, we also need to add the `authorization` header to all the requests (we will configure ajax to do this automatically for every request).

You can read a quickstart guide for this sample [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/jquery/08-calling-apis)

## Before running the example

Rename `auth0-variables.js.example` to `auth0-variables.js` and make sure that you have both the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`in it. You can find that information in the settings section of your Auth0 Client. Also, make sure to add the callback URL (`http://localhost:3000/` if you are testing locally) in the **Allowed Callback URLs** section, as explained [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/jquery/01-login#before-starting)

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
2. run `npm install -g serve`
3. run `serve` in the directory of the project.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running :).


# Important Snippets

## 1. Add Lock dependency

```html
<!-- ===== ./index.html ===== -->
<head>
  ...
  <!-- Auth0 Lock script -->
  <script src="http://cdn.auth0.com/js/lock/10.8/lock.min.js"></script>
  ...
</head>
```

## 2. Configure ajax to make authenticated requests

```javascript
/* ===== ./app.js ===== */
...
$.ajaxSetup({
  'beforeSend': function(xhr) {
    if (localStorage.getItem('id_token')) {
      xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization',
            'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('id_token'));
    }
  }
});
...
```

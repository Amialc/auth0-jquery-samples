# Auth0 + jQuery

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an app that will use Auth0 + jQuery.

You can read a quickstart guide for this sample [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/jquery).

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
2. run `npm install -g serve`
3. run `serve` in the directory of the project.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running :).
